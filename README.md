# Sales Dashboard with Excel - Data Analyst Project 
Welcome to the Sales Dashboard project repository! This project is dedicated to analyzing and visualizing the sales data of a US-based company from the years 2014 to 2017. By leveraging Excel, we’ve developed an interactive and user-friendly dashboard that allows users to explore detailed sales performance metrics. The dashboard is designed to offer comprehensive insights into how various product categories performed across different states, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions. It provides an easy-to-understand interface to track trends, compare sales figures, and uncover key patterns, all contributing to a better understanding of the company’s overall sales performance during this time period.
